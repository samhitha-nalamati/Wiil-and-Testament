# Will and Testament

## Project Description

A blockchain-based digital inheritance management system built on the Aptos network. This smart contract enables individuals to create secure, automated digital wills that ensure their cryptocurrency assets are transferred to designated beneficiaries after a specified time period, eliminating the need for traditional legal intermediaries and providing transparent, immutable inheritance solutions.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize estate planning and digital asset inheritance by creating a decentralized, trustless system where individuals can securely manage and transfer their digital wealth to future generations. Our vision is to make inheritance planning accessible, affordable, and globally available while maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency through blockchain technology.
